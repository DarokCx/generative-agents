Carmen Ortiz: Excuse me, hi there! I couldn't help but notice your paintings. They look amazing.
Rajiv Patel: Oh, thank you! I'm Rajiv. Nice to meet you.
Carmen Ortiz: I'm Carmen. Likewise! Are you preparing for a show?
Rajiv Patel: Yes, actually. My first solo show.
Carmen Ortiz: Congratulations! I'm also involved in the creative scene here. I'm managing a supply store and expanding it online. I'm always looking for opportunities to promote local artists.
Rajiv Patel: That's great! I'm also interested in collaborating on projects with others.
Carmen Ortiz: Wow, it sounds like we have a lot in common. I've been discussing potential art projects with Jennifer Moore, and I'm always interested in finding new ways to promote art in low-income communities.
Rajiv Patel: That's really cool. I've had similar discussions with Latoya Williams and Ryan Park. And I'm also interested in attending discussions about the local mayoral election and exploring connections between math, nature, and art.
Carmen Ortiz: That's fascinating! I recently discussed the topic of medicinal development using mathematical patterns found in nature with Ryan Park.
Rajiv Patel: Wow, that's really interesting. It would be great to collaborate on something like that in the future.
Carmen Ortiz: Definitely! Do you have any plans after the show? We could grab a drink and discuss further collaborations.
Rajiv Patel: I would love that. How about The Rose and Crown Pub? It's close by.
Carmen Ortiz: Sounds perfect. Looking forward to it.
